        <p>As you can see in these two photos of police brutality innocent human being have been brutaly beaten you can find these images any where these just like this one, but there far more worse than these two. Through out the world I have watched and seen a lot crazy events on TV when it comes these police brutality reports and alot of these events end up getting people killed lives are at staick and some one or something out there must change.</p>
        <p>Police brutality has become over the top most violent brtual crimes through out this nation and must be dropped and if you want more info visit the new york time website and you will see a lot news passing through when it comes to police brutality https://www.nytimes.com/topic/subject/police-brutality-misconduct-and-shootings.some people have lost all hope but there is still time hopefully in the future something will change is us and the people can be able to change.</p>
